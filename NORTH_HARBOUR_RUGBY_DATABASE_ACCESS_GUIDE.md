```
Google Sheets ‚Üí API Sync ‚Üí External Database ‚Üí Rugby App

## üí∞ **Cost Management**

### **Monthly Database Costs**
- **Small Club (50 players):** $10-25/month
- **Medium Club (100+ players):** $25-50/month
- **Large Operations (multiple teams):** $50-100/month

### **Cost Monitoring**
The external database provider will send you monthly usage reports and billing statements directly to your email.

### **Optimization Tips**
1. **Regular Cleanup:** Archive old seasons annually
2. **Efficient Queries:** Use indexes for frequently accessed data
3. **Backup Strategy:** Regular backups prevent data loss costs
4. **Monitor Usage:** Track query frequency and storage growth

---

## üîê **Security and Access Control**

### **Database User Management**
Create separate database users for different staff roles:

```sql
-- Head Coach (Full Access)
CREATE USER head_coach WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES TO head_coach;

-- Medical Staff (Medical Data Only)
CREATE USER medical_staff WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON players TO medical_staff;

-- Analyst (Read-Only)
CREATE USER analyst WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES TO analyst;
```

### **Best Practices**
1. **Unique Passwords:** Each staff member has own database login
2. **Regular Updates:** Change passwords quarterly
3. **Access Logging:** Monitor who accesses what data
4. **Backup Verification:** Test backup restoration monthly
