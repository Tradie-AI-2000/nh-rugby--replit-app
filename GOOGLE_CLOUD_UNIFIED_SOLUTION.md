# üèâ Google Cloud Unified Solution for North Harbour Rugby

## **Google Cloud AlloyDB vs BigQuery vs Cloud SQL**

### **BigQuery Analysis**
**Pros:**
- Serverless and cost-effective for analytics
- Perfect for large-scale data analysis
- Integrates seamlessly with Google ecosystem
- Pay-per-query pricing model

**Cons:**
- Not designed for transactional operations (CRUD)
- No real-time updates for web apps
- Limited to analytical queries, not operational database
- Not suitable for user authentication/sessions

**Verdict:** BigQuery is excellent for rugby analytics and reporting, but not suitable as the primary operational database for your rugby app.

## **üí° Cost Optimization Strategies**

### **Cloud SQL Optimization**
```
1. Use db-f1-micro (shared CPU) - 70% cheaper
2. HDD storage instead of SSD - 60% cheaper  
3. Single-zone deployment - 50% cheaper
4. Automated scaling during off-season
5. Scheduled instance stops during off-season
```

### **BigQuery Optimization**
```
1. Use partitioned tables by date
2. Cluster by frequently queried columns
3. Use BigQuery slots for predictable costs
4. Archive old data to Cloud Storage
5. Use materialized views for common queries
```

### **Unified Cost Management**
```
Monthly Budget Alerts:
- Cloud SQL: $10 threshold
- BigQuery: $10 threshold  
- Total project: $25 threshold
- Automatic scaling policies
```

## **üîß Technical Implementation**

### **Cloud SQL Setup (Cost-Optimized)**
```
1. Create Cloud SQL instance:
   - Type: db-f1-micro
   - Storage: 10GB HDD
   - Region: us-central1 (cheapest)
   - Backup: 7 days
   - No high availability

2. Database configuration:
   - Name: rugby_performance
   - User: rugby_admin
   - SSL: Required
   - Authorized networks: Replit IPs
```

### **BigQuery Setup**
```
1. Create BigQuery dataset:
   - Dataset: north_harbour_analytics
   - Location: US (multi-region)
   - Table expiration: 2 years

2. Create tables:
   - player_performance_history
   - match_analytics
   - season_comparisons
   - injury_patterns
```

### **Data Sync Process**
```javascript
// Scheduled Cloud Function (daily sync)
async function syncToBigQuery() {
  const players = await cloudSQL.query('SELECT * FROM players');
  const matches = await cloudSQL.query('SELECT * FROM matches');
  
  await bigQuery.table('player_performance_history').insert(players);
  await bigQuery.table('match_analytics').insert(matches);
}
```

## **üìà Rugby-Specific Analytics with BigQuery**

### **Performance Analysis Queries**
```sql
-- Season performance trends
SELECT 
  player_name,
  position,
  AVG(tries_scored) as avg_tries,
  AVG(tackles_made) as avg_tackles,
  COUNT(*) as games_played
FROM `north_harbour_analytics.player_performance_history`
WHERE season = '2024'
GROUP BY player_name, position
ORDER BY avg_tries DESC;

-- Injury pattern analysis
SELECT 
  injury_type,
  position,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  AVG(recovery_days) as avg_recovery
FROM `north_harbour_analytics.injury_patterns`
GROUP BY injury_type, position
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Match performance by opponent
SELECT 
  opponent,
  AVG(tries_scored) as avg_tries,
  AVG(points_scored) as avg_points,
  COUNT(*) as matches_played
FROM `north_harbour_analytics.match_analytics`
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY avg_points DESC;
```

### **Predictive Analytics**
```sql
-- Player development trajectory
WITH player_trends AS (
  SELECT 
    player_id,
    player_name,
    match_date,
    performance_score,
    LAG(performance_score, 4) OVER (
      PARTITION BY player_id 
      ORDER BY match_date
    ) as score_4_games_ago
  FROM `north_harbour_analytics.player_performance_history`
)
SELECT 
  player_name,
  (performance_score - score_4_games_ago) / 4 as improvement_rate
FROM player_trends
WHERE score_4_games_ago IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY improvement_rate DESC;
```
