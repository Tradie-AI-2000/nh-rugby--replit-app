Instructions for Building NorthHarbourPerformance SaaS
The NorthHarbourPerformance dashboard will be a React.js application hosted on Replit, designed to visualize and analyze cohesion metrics for North Harbour Rugby. It will cater to various stakeholders including coaches, players, medical staff, and administrators.

I. Technical Stack
Frontend: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS (for modern, responsive UI)
Charting: Recharts (for dynamic data visualization)
Data Persistence & Authentication: Google Firestore (real-time, scalable NoSQL database)
II. Core Dashboard Features (with technical notes)
The dashboard will consist of several key sections, each visualizing different aspects of team cohesion:

Overall Cohesion Overview:

Display current Team Work Index (TWI) and In-Season Cohesion scores prominently.
Technical: Fetch these values from Firestore and display as large, clear numbers or gauges.
Historical Cohesion Trends:

Line charts showing the progression of TWI and In-Season Cohesion over multiple seasons/years (similar to the RUNY TWI Progression chart).
Technical: Use Recharts.LineChart components. Data for these charts will be arrays of objects containing date and value fields stored in Firestore.
Cohesion Markers Breakdown:

Gaps Analysis:
Visualize "0" Gaps, Attack Spine "0" Gaps, and 0-5 Defensive Gaps.
Technical: Display these as numerical values with color-coded indicators (e.g., green for good, red for high gaps) or simple bar charts comparing current values to benchmarks/averages. The document shows network diagrams for "Gaps," but for a simplified initial build, we will represent these as quantifiable metrics rather than attempting complex, dynamic graph visualizations.
Squad Profile (Age & Experience):
Display Age Differential, Average Age of Squad, and Average Age of Signing.
Display Experience Differential (Internal vs. External Experience).
Histograms for Age of Signing Profile and Internal Tenure Breakdown (showing number of players at different signing ages/tenures).
Technical: Use Recharts.BarChart for histograms. Display other metrics as numerical values.
Performance Correlation Insights:

Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between Cohesion Markers (e.g., "0" Gaps, In-Season Cohesion) and key performance metrics (e.g., Competition Points, Points For, Points Against).
Technical: Use Recharts.ScatterChart. These will require both cohesion data and corresponding match performance data.
Squad Stability:

Display the Change Score (average lineup changes per game).
Technical: Numerical display, possibly with a historical line chart.
Benchmark Comparison:

Ability to compare North Harbour's current and historical cohesion metrics against a predefined benchmark team (e.g., Crusaders, as highlighted in the documents).
Technical: Fetch benchmark data from Firestore and overlay it on charts or display side-by-side with North Harbour's data.
