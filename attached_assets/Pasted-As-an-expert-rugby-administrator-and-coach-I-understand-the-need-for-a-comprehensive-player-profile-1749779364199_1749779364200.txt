As an expert rugby administrator and coach, I understand the need for a comprehensive player profile that goes beyond traditional metrics and incorporates "moneyball" concepts. The goal is to identify and quantify a player's true value, including their impact on team cohesion, which is crucial for sustained success.

Based on the PLAYER kpiS - Sheet1.csv analysis, and integrating it with the cohesion concepts from the previous documents, here are the instructions for building a comprehensive player profile within your Replit-based SaaS, "NorthHarbourPerformance."
