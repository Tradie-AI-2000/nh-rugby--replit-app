## üîß **PART 2: Making Direct Database Changes (Emergency Only)**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FIRST**

**Before Making Any Changes:**
1. **ALWAYS make a backup** - In Neon Console, go to "Backups" ‚Üí "Create Backup"
2. **Test changes on one player first** before bulk edits
3. **Never delete entire tables** - this will break your app
4. **Double-check player names/IDs** - typos can cause issues

### **Simple Data Editing**

**Method 1: Neon Console (Simplest)**
```
1. Go to Neon Console ‚Üí Tables ‚Üí players
2. Click "Browse Data"
3. Find the player you want to edit
4. Click the pencil icon next to their row
5. Make your changes
6. Click "Save"
```

**Common Safe Edits:**
- Change player status: "Fit" ‚Üí "Injured" ‚Üí "Suspended"
- Update jersey numbers (make sure they're unique)
- Modify basic stats like weight, height
- Update contact information

**Method 2: Using a Database Tool (More Advanced)**
```
Download: DBeaver (free database browser)
1. Install DBeaver on your computer
2. Connect using your Neon database URL
3. Browse tables in a familiar spreadsheet interface
4. Make edits with right-click ‚Üí Edit
```

### **What NOT to Touch**
- `id` fields (these are unique identifiers)
- `createdAt` or `updatedAt` timestamps
- Complex JSON fields unless you understand the structure
- Any table structure/columns themselves

---

## üìä **PART 3: Google Sheets Integration (Primary Data Management)**

### **How Data Flows: The Complete Picture**

```
Google Sheets ‚Üí API Sync ‚Üí Neon Database ‚Üí Rugby App Frontend
```

### **Step-by-Step: From Sheets to App**

**Step 1: Your Google Sheet Setup**
```
Create a Google Sheet with these exact column headers:
A: Player Name
B: Position  
C: Jersey Number
D: Weight (kg)
E: Height (cm)
F: Age
G: Fitness Score (1-10)
H: Injury Status (Fit/Injured/Suspended)
I: Last Match Date
J: GPS Distance (meters)
K: Top Speed (km/h)
L: Tackles (season total)
M: Carries (season total)
N: Pass Accuracy (percentage)
```

**Step 2: Making Data Changes**
```
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Edit any player data you need to change
3. Save the sheet (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
```

**Step 3: Syncing to Database**
```
Option A: Manual Sync (Current Setup)
1. Open your Rugby App
2. Go to Admin/Settings section
3. Click "Sync from Google Sheets"
4. Enter your Google Sheet ID
5. Click "Import Data"

Option B: Automatic Sync (Would need to be set up)
- Data automatically syncs every hour
- No manual action required
```

**Step 4: Data Appears in App**
```
Once synced:
1. Player changes appear immediately on all pages
2. Squad Builder shows updated availability
3. Medical Hub reflects new injury statuses
4. Player profiles display latest stats
5. Reports include updated data
```

### **Your Current API Endpoints Explained**

**What happens when you sync:**
```
POST /api/sheets/sync-all
- Reads your entire Google Sheet
- Transforms data to match rugby app format
- Updates player records in Neon database
- Returns success/error message

POST /api/sheets/sync-matches  
- Imports match-specific data
- Updates game statistics
- Calculates performance metrics
```

**How to Trigger These:**
Currently, these are triggered through the app interface when you click sync buttons. The app makes these API calls automatically.

## üí∞ **PART 4: Cost Monitoring and Control**

### **Understanding Neon Costs**

**Main Cost Drivers:**
1. **Storage** - How much data you store (player records, match data)
2. **Compute** - How many database operations per month
3. **Data Transfer** - Moving data in/out of database

**Typical North Harbour Usage Costs:**
- Small club (50 players): $0-20/month
- Medium club (100+ players): $20-50/month  
- Large operations (multiple teams): $50-100/month

### **Cost Monitoring Dashboard**

**Step 1: Check Usage**
```
1. Go to Neon Console
2. Click "Billing" or "Usage" tab
3. View current month's consumption
```

**Step 2: Set Up Alerts**
```
1. In Neon Console ‚Üí Settings
2. Set spending alerts (e.g., notify at $25/month)
3. Add your email for notifications
```

**Step 3: Monitor Key Metrics**
- **Storage**: Should grow slowly unless adding lots of players
- **Compute**: Spikes during heavy app usage (match days)
- **Queries**: Should be consistent unless experiencing issues

### **Cost Control Tips**
1. **Regular cleanup** - Archive old seasons annually
2. **Optimize images** - Compress player photos before upload
3. **Monitor sync frequency** - Don't sync Google Sheets more than needed
4. **Review usage monthly** - Check for unexpected spikes
